# DelphiCanvas
## Delphi-Classes TCanvas, TBrush, TPen, TFont in an ActiveX.dll  
In 1999 I was a Delphi-Developer, but 2000 I got a Job as Visual Basic-Developer.
Coming from Delphi, I was used to the very handsome Delphi-GDI-Classes TCanvas etc.
I wanted to have this in VB to be more free, so I ported the Code vom Delphi to VB.
Project started in june 2000
